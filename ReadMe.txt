DeepL now the Default translator, you can edit the translator config to your liking in the AutoTranslatorConfig.ini located at BepinEX\BepInEx\config

You can change translations to your liking in the translator cache (\BepInEx\Translation\en\Text\_AutoGeneratedTranslations.txt)

If you find Deepl too slow you can use the DeepL API which you can find here https://www.deepl.com/pro-api?cta=header-pro-api. Deepl requires a credit card in order
to gain access to the free version of the API

	1. open the AutoTranslatorConfig.ini and replace "DeepLTranslate"  on the endpoint with "DeepLTranslateLegitimate"
	
	2. Scroll down to the DeepLLegitimate settings which should look like this


		[DeepLLegitimate]
		ExecutableLocation=
		ApiKey=
		Free=False

	   Change Free=True and add the API key you obtained from DeepL

	   
		[DeepLLegitimate]
		ExecutableLocation=
		ApiKey=[INSERT API KEY HERE]
		Free=True

DeepL API has a 500,000 character translation limit, so as a backup you can add GoogleTranslateV2 to the FallbackEndpoint

		[Service]
		Endpoint=DeepLTranslateLegitimate
		FallbackEndpoint=GoogleTranslateV2

if the issue with controller prompts being broken due to the font annoys you, you can change the font by changing

OverrideFontTextMeshPro=p5

to

OverrideFontTextMeshPro=arialuni_sdf_u2019

in AutoTranslatorConfig.ini

if you want the Autotranslations from the github if the generation is too slow, then you can change it to where it downloads the latest _AutoGeneratedTranslation file from
the github by changing "AutoGen = false" to "AutoGen = true" in P5XTranslateDL.cfg (located [game]\client\pc\BepInEx\config\P5XTranslateDL.cfg)
